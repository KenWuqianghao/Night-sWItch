# Night-sWItch
A chrome extension that changes the new tab background image according to time. 

When the extension starts, the new tab page becomes blank because it doesn't know what image to use as the wallpaper, so go to extension options and upload all the required fields and click save, then the new tab would automatically change according to your specifications. Enjoy
